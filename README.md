# Clipboard Turbo
Clipboard Turbo is a tool to establish a collection of often used information e.g. name, address, e-mail address. The user can then send these information to his clipboard, with only one click.

- The list consists of information - value pairs

- Click on any item in the list and you will see its value will be sent to your clipboard:

- Use the control buttons to create new entries or edit / delete existing ones.


Click on the "Settings" tab to change following settings:

- "Path of application files": The standard path is already set into your appdata folder. You can change this to any path you want.
- "Keyboard shortcut": Click into the textbox and type in a keyboard combination like "ALT + P" or "SHIFT + M"  (Modifier + Key). You can then use this combination to bring Clipboard Turbo to the foreground anytime!
- "Keep window on top": Check this if you want Clipboard Turbo to stay in the foreground all the time. For example this is useful when filling out a formular in a webbrowser and you want Clipboard Turbo to stay on top while you copy and paste values.
- "Start with Windows": Check this if you want Clipboard Turbo to start with Windows.

Tip: Use both "Keyboard shortcut" and "Start with Windows" and you can use your keyboard shortcut anytime to bring up Clipboard Turbo without bothering to start the application manually before.

- "Empty whole list": Only use that button if you want to delete all your information data.

- When closing Clipboard Turbo, it gets minimized and moved to background. Only then the keyboard shortcut works.
